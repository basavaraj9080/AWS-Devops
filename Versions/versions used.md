Here’s a **simple, confident, interview-ready way** to answer:

---

# ✅ **1. Docker**

### ✅ **Stable Version (Industry Standard)**

**Docker Engine 26.x (LTS Stable Line)**
(Stable releases in 2025 are in the 26.x family)

### ✅ **Version Used in My Project**

**Docker 25.x / 24.x** (Example: **24.0.7**)

### ✅ Add-on Talking Points

* Used Docker Compose v2
* Built optimized images using multi-stage Dockerfiles
* Stored images in Amazon ECR

---

# ✅ **2. Jenkins**

### ✅ **Stable LTS Version**

**Jenkins 2.452.x LTS**
(LTS versions are recommended for production)

### ✅ **Version Used in My Project**

**Jenkins 2.426.x LTS** (Example: **2.426.1**)

### ✅ Add-on Talking Points

* Used Pipeline-as-Code (Declarative Jenkinsfile)
* Integrated with GitHub Webhooks
* Configured agents using Docker/Kubernetes
* Implemented RBAC and folder-level access

---

# ✅ **3. Kubernetes / Amazon EKS**

### ✅ **Stable EKS Kubernetes Versions**

AWS typically supports the latest 3–4 minor versions.
Stable in 2025:

* **Kubernetes 1.29** (Current Stable)
* **Kubernetes 1.28** (Widely adopted)

### ✅ **Version Used in My Project**

**Amazon EKS 1.27 / 1.28**

### ✅ Add-on Talking Points

* Used managed node groups
* Configured Cluster Autoscaler + HPA
* Implemented IRSA for fine-grained IAM access
* Deployed workloads using Helm

# ✅ How to Speak This in an Interview

**Sample Answer:**

> “For Docker, the current stable line is around the 26.x releases, but in my project we used Docker 24.0.7 because it was certified and compatible with our CI pipeline.
> For Jenkins, the stable LTS build today is 2.452, but in production we used Jenkins 2.426.1 LTS for long-term support.
> For Kubernetes on EKS, the industry stable version is Kubernetes 1.29, while our cluster ran on EKS 1.28 since AWS recommends staying within the latest supported versions.”

# ✅ Pro Tip for Interviews

If you’re unsure of exact numbers, say:

✅ “We always preferred LTS/stable versions and followed vendor support timelines.”

This shows maturity and real-world experience.
