Here is a **detailed, interview-focused explanation of AWS VPC (subnets, NAT, routing)** — the **#6** item from your list — tailored for a **6-year experienced DevOps/AWS engineer**.

---

# ⭐ **AWS VPC – Detailed Explanation (For 6 Years Experience)**

> VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) is the core networking foundation of AWS.
> Interviewers expect you to understand VPC design, troubleshooting, security, and multi-account networking.

---

# 🔶 **1. What is a VPC?**

A **Virtual Private Cloud** is an isolated logical network in AWS where you launch your resources (EC2, RDS, EKS, ECS, etc.).

You control:

* IP addressing (CIDR blocks)
* Subnets (public/private)
* Routing rules
* NAT, IGW
* Security (SGs, NACLs)
* VPC Endpoints
* Peering / Transit Gateway connectivity

---

# 🔶 **2. CIDR Block Planning (Interview Level Expected)**

* You specify a CIDR block like `10.0.0.0/16`.
* This gives 65k IPs; typically divided across AZs.

A standard 3-tier design:

* `10.0.0.0/24` → public subnet AZ1
* `10.0.1.0/24` → private subnet AZ1
* `10.0.2.0/24` → public subnet AZ2
* `10.0.3.0/24` → private subnet AZ2

Interview Tip:
Explain how you avoid IP conflicts using AWS IPAM or manually designing CIDR ranges.

---

# 🔶 **3. Subnets – Public vs Private**

# 🌐 **What is a Subnet in AWS?**

A **Subnet** (Sub-Network) is a **logical subdivision** of a VPC’s IP address range.
It allows you to organize and isolate resources within your VPC.

In simple words:

👉 **A subnet is a smaller network inside your VPC where you run EC2, RDS, and other resources.**

---

# 🔹 **Why do we create Subnets?**

1. **Segregation of resources**

   * Public subnet → resources with internet access (e.g., ALB, Bastion Host)
   * Private subnet → resources without direct internet access (e.g., databases, app servers)

2. **Better security**
   Applying different route tables + NACLs gives granular control.

3. **High availability across AZs**
   You create subnets in **multiple Availability Zones** for redundancy.

4. **Traffic control**
   Separate private and public workloads.

---

# 🔹 **Types of Subnets**

### **1️⃣ Public Subnet**

* Has a route to the **Internet Gateway (IGW)**
* Used for:

  * Load Balancers
  * Bastion Hosts
  * Public-facing applications

### **2️⃣ Private Subnet**

* No direct route to IGW
* Can access the internet through NAT Gateway
* Used for:

  * EC2 backends
  * Databases (RDS)
  * Internal services

### **3️⃣ Isolated Subnet**

* No route to the internet at all (not even through NAT)
* Used for:

  * Highly secure workloads
  * Sensitive databases

---

# 🔹 **Subnet Example**

If your VPC is:

```
10.0.0.0/16
```

You can divide it into multiple subnets:

```
10.0.1.0/24  → Public Subnet (AZ1)
10.0.2.0/24  → Private Subnet (AZ1)
10.0.3.0/24  → Public Subnet (AZ2)
10.0.4.0/24  → Private Subnet (AZ2)
```

---

# 🔹 **Subnet Key Properties**

* Must belong to **one Availability Zone**
* Cannot span multiple AZs
* Each subnet has:

  * Route table
  * ACL
  * A portion of IP range
  * Optional NAT Gateway or IGW access

---

# 🎯 **Interview-ready Definition**

> “A subnet is a segment of a VPC’s IP address range. It helps divide a VPC into smaller networks for organizing, securing, and isolating resources. Subnets can be public, private, or isolated based on their routing.”

---

# 🔶 **4. Internet Gateway (IGW)**

Allows:

* Outbound internet traffic from public subnets
* Inbound internet traffic to public resources

Important:
IGW does **not** perform NAT. It only enables traffic.

---

# 🔶 **5. NAT Gateway vs NAT Instance**

### **NAT Gateway (Recommended)**

* Fully managed
* High availability (if deployed per AZ)
* Scales automatically
* Expensive

### **NAT Instance**

* EC2 instance
* Cheap but requires maintenance
* Single point of failure unless autoscaled
* Throughput is limited by instance size

Interview Tip:
Explaining why NAT Gateway should be deployed **per AZ** is important — cross-AZ traffic incurs cost + reduces HA.

---

# 🔶 **6. Route Tables**

Route tables determine how traffic flows in/out of subnets.

🚦 What is a Route Table in AWS?

A Route Table contains a set of rules—called routes—that determine how network traffic flows inside a VPC.

Think of it like a map that tells your subnet:
👉 “Where should this traffic go?”

Every subnet must be associated with one route table.

🧩 Why Route Tables Are Needed

    Route tables control:

      Internet access

      Within-VPC communication

      Communication between subnets

      VPC peering

      NAT Gateway routing

      On-prem connectivity (VPN / Direct Connect)

      Transit Gateway routing

      Without route tables, nothing knows where to send traffic.

### **Public Subnet Route Table**

```
0.0.0.0/0 → igw-xxxx
```

### **Private Subnet Route Table**

For outbound internet:
No inbound from the internet.

```
0.0.0.0/0 → nat-gw
```

### **🔹 How Route Tables Work (Simple Explanation)**

- An EC2 instance sends a packet.

- Packet looks at the subnet’s associated route table.

- Route table checks:

- Is the destination IP inside the VPC? → Send via local route

- Is it external? → Follow matching route (IGW/NAT/VPN/etc.)

- Traffic reaches the correct target.

### **VPC Peering**

Add specific CIDR routes for the peered VPC.

### **Transit Gateway**

https://github.com/basavaraj9080/AWS-Devops/blob/main/VPC/vpc%20peering.md

Route using TGW attachment IDs.

Interview Tip:
You should be able to design and explain multi-VPC routing.

---

# 🔶 **7. Security Groups vs NACLs**

### **Security Groups**

* Instance-level
* Stateful
* Only allow rules
* Return traffic automatically allowed

### **NACLs**

* Subnet-level
* Stateless
* Allow + Deny rules
* Return traffic must be explicitly allowed

Interview Tip:
Explain common troubleshooting:

* SG allows but NACL blocks (stateless behavior)

---

# 🔶 **8. VPC Endpoints (Interface + Gateway)**

Used for **private access** to AWS services without internet.

### **Interface Endpoints (powered by ENI)**

Used for:

* SSM
* EC2 API
* CloudWatch Logs
* S3 (new interface option too)

### **Gateway Endpoints**

Only for:

* S3
* DynamoDB

Use cases:

* Private traffic inside AWS
* No need for NAT Gateway
* Reduces cost & improves security

Interview Tip:
Explain how EKS nodes in private subnets access ECR/S3 via VPC endpoints.

---

# 🔶 **9. VPC Peering vs Transit Gateway**

### **VPC Peering**

* One-to-one
* Non-transitive
* No overlapping CIDR

### **Transit Gateway**

* Hub-and-spoke
* Large multi-VPC management
* Transitive routing supported
* Best for enterprise scale

Interview Tip:
Explain when "transitive routing" becomes necessary → microservices in multiple VPCs.

---

# 🔶 **10. PrivateLink**

Provides **private access to third-party or cross-account services** using ENIs.

Use cases:

* Access partner APIs privately
* SaaS integration
* Cross-account service exposure

---

# 🔶 **11. Typical 3-Tier Secure Architecture (Expected in Interviews)**

### **Public Subnets**

* ALB
* NAT Gateway

### **Private App Subnets**

* EC2/ECS/EKS
* Lambda inside VPC

### **Private DB Subnets**

* RDS
* ElastiCache

### With routing:

* App → DB (private)
* App → Internet via NAT
* ALB → App (public → private)

---

# 🔶 **12. Common VPC Troubleshooting (Interview Must-Know)**

### **Case 1: EC2 cannot access the internet**

Check:

* Is EC2 in private subnet?
* NAT Gateway configured?
* Route table to NAT?
* Security group outbound rule?

### **Case 2: Database not accessible**

Check:

* NACL denies?
* Wrong SG inbound?
* Route tables missing local route?
* Wrong subnet?

### **Case 3: ALB can’t reach target**

Check:

* SG on target allows ALB SG
* Health check path correct
* NACL blocking?
* Target in private subnet?

---
